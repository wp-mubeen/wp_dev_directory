Have a look at the [Boxzilla demo site](https://demo.boxzillaplugin.com/#utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&utm_medium=boxzilla&utm_campaign=description).

= How to display a form in the box? =

Boxzilla will work with any plugin that offers shortcodes, like [MailChimp for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/).

Sure, by linking to the box element.

*Example (box ID is 94 in this example)*

`

All default WordPress filters are added to the `stb_content` filter hook. If you want to remove any of them, add the respectable line to your theme its `functions.php` file.

`

add_filter( 'boxzilla_box_options', function( $opts, $box ) {
	$opts['closable'] = false;
	return $opts;
}, 10, 2 );
`
