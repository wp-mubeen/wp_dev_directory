"Before discovering Squirrly SEO, my SEO tool of choice was Yoast. But I've never really felt using that SEO tool well as I am not an SEO expert and don't have the time to invest too many hours learning about SEO optimization."
That's why Squirrly came in to help me with that process: I like their guide and the steps explaining what to do next in order to get it working. That's great for me!

<h3>Powerful yet Lightweight - Squirrly SEO loads faster than any other SEO plugin</h3>

The Squirrly SEO plugin doesn't impact your pagespeed - as it loads super fast with a WordPress site.
 (demonstrated in the LIVE TEST below)
https://howto.squirrly.co/faq/is-squirrly-seo-a-heavy-plugin/

The advantage that enables Squirrly SEO to load faster than any other SEO plugin currently on the market: 

This amazing feat is thanks to the SaaS + SEO plugin duality which is unique to Squirrly SEO.

650 Features in Squirrly SEO, but the processing and heavy lifting is done on Squirrly Limited (the company)’s private servers. That makes the WordPress SEO plugin load incredibly fast.

Also, from our tests, the Squirrly SEO plugin loads on the frontend in 0.005s if you’re not using a plugin for caching. 

We integrated the Squirrly SEO plugin with the most popular plugins for caching like WP Super Cache, WP-Rocket, Autoptimize, W3 Total, and more. This way, the buffer only loads through the plugins for caching and the speed is not affected at all. 

<h3>SEO feels like a dark art? With Squirrly, you don't have to do it alone</h3>

With so many variables at play, SEO can seem blindingly complex. 

Like you're trying to solve one huge puzzle, and it's up to you to try and make sense of how all the pieces fit together.

It's easy to get overwhelmed by the breadth of knowledge and attention to detail necessary. 

So many people end up putting SEO off over and over. 

Not if you're using Squirrly.

With features such as Next SEO Goals and Focus Pages, Squirrly helps you navigate today's key ranking factors by providing you with a complete framework and step-by-step guidance for placing your pages at the top of Google Search.

It's like having an SEO expert in your WordPress site telling you what to do next to rank higher.

★★★★★
" I'm new to SEO and, to be honest, it felt a bit like jabbing into the dark, having no real idea how optimized my content is (or isn't). But with Squirrly's content editor, it's crystal clear what I need to do to rank.

After following its guidelines and rewriting some of my articles, one of them showed up on the first page of Google! "

It's a small win but one that gives me absolute confidence that if I put in the work, I'll get the SEO results I'm hoping for in due time.

Though, there is A LOT more to this tool than just the content editor. It really covers pretty much everything you need to do for on-page SEO stuff.

If you're new to SEO like I am, I suggest grabbing this.

<h3>Reach the 1st Page of Google and actually have Fun getting there</h3>

You know SEO is important but just hearing the word optimize makes you want to gouge your eyes out? You're not alone.

Even if you have a clue of what you're doing and what you should be focusing on, Search Engine Optimization can still feel like a giant tedious ball of blah.

We wanted to change that, because if SEO feels like a repetitious chore - it's hard to stay consistent with your efforts.

Unlike other SEO tools that simply tell you to press this and that, Squirrly gamifies the SEO experience to help you turn SEO work into an exciting habit.

Every day, you'll get about 3 New, High-Priority SEO Goals that you have to accomplish to optimize your website - complete with step-by-step instructions on how to get the job done.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Squirrly together with Rank Math? Could I replace Rank Math altogether with Squirrly? =
Yes, you can use Squirrly SEO alongside Rank Math if you want to, as Squirrly enables you to deactivate certain settings or modules so that Squirrly SEO and Rank Math can work in compatibility mode.

If Squirrly stops handling source code changes, then it works with Rank Math, SEOpress, All In One SEO SEO, Yoast, and others. Regarding whether you could replace Rank Math altogether with Squirrly SEO, this graphic linked below shows you a side-by-side comparison of Squirrly SEO vs. Rank Math.

There are around 650 features in Squirrly SEO, most of which can’t be found in Rank Math, given that Rank Math does not offer a duality between plugin and cloud services.

https://plugin.squirrly.co/compare/#vsrankmath

= Can we import data from Rank Math into Squirrly SEO? =
Yes, you can easily import all settings and all page optimizations made with Rank Math, using our import features. This provides step-by-step documentation on how to migrate your data from Rank Math so that you don’t lose your previous SEO optimization. 

https://howto.squirrly.co/wordpress-seo/how-to-switch-from-rank-math-to-squirrly-seo/

= Are Focus Pages similar to Pillar Content in Rank Math? =
You can search for “focus pages” on this page:

https://www.squirrly.co/wordpress/plugins/second-seo-features-page/

You will see there all that it offers. It is incredibly valuable for SEO and does everything required for SEO, unlike the pillar feature in Rank Math. It offers more than even Moz or Ahrefs does in terms of content analysis. 

Side by side comparison: Squirrly SEO versus Rank Math 

https://plugin.squirrly.co/compare/#vsrankmath

Powered by advanced cloud servers owned by the Squirrly Company, the MarketIntelligence big data analysis we do, and data sources like: Moz, Majestic, Alexa, Semrush, Google Analytics, ContentLook, crawlers owned by Squirrly: we are in a unique position that allows us to do in-depth content analysis and see each page the same way that Google’s algorithms see it.

= How does Squirrly, marketing and marketshare wise, compete with SEOPress, Rank Math, All in One SEO? =
We have been around since 2012 and we’ve validated over 17 products already with money paid by customers. There are few startups that could show the same results.

https://howto.squirrly.co/faq/how-does-squirrly-marketing-and-marketshare-wise-compete/

= Can the Squirrly SEO plugin be used together with Yoast,  SEOPress, Rank Math, Premium SEO Pack, All in One SEO, SEO Framework? =
Yes, you can use Squirrly SEO alongside other SEO plugins like Yoast, Rank Math, SEO Press, Premium SEO Pack, All in One SEO, or SEO Framework in compatibility mode. 

You can learn more about how to use Squirrly SEO in compatibility mode here. 

https://howto.squirrly.co/wordpress-seo/use-squirrly-in-compatibility-mode-with-other-seo-plugins/

If Squirrly stops handling source code changes, then it works with Rank Math, SEOpress, SEO Pressor, All in One SEO, Yoast, SEO Framework, and others.

Basically, you can use Squirrly SEO to power up WP on top of everything that is already handled by the other WordPress SEO plugin you’re using. Of course, you can also decide to switch to Squirrly, as it offers the complete SEO funnel.

Check out these graphics

https://plugin.squirrly.co/compare/

to see how Squirrly compares to other SEO plugins such as Yoast, Rank Math, SEOPress, SEO Framework, and All in One SEO.

= How does Squirrly compare with plugins like SEO Framework, SEO Press, Rank Math, All in one SEO, or Yoast in terms of site speed and pagespeed? =
Most of the processing, data storage, and other things that only Squirrly SEO can do, are actually things that happen on our Cloud Servers. The duality between plugin and Cloud Services (APIs, crawlers, big data, A.I., MarketIntelligence services) allows us to load the plugin’s code very fast.

The duality between SEO plugin and Cloud Services gives us an advantage over other WordPress SEO plugins like SEO Framework, SEO Press, Rank Math, All in One SEO, Rank Math, and Yoast.

https://howto.squirrly.co/kb/sitemap-xml-settings/

Squirrly provides Schema for Local Business. Coordinates, hours, menus, etc. are available. You can learn more about this here.

https://howto.squirrly.co/kb/json-ld-structured-data/

Meta Data for GEO and Location – Especially helpful for Local SEO and Knowledge Graph

This will be used for your Organization and for Publisher details within your WordPress site.

Schema for Local SEO can now be built directly from WordPress – Squirrly – SEO Settings – JSON-LD.

https://howto.squirrly.co/kb/bulk-seo/

= How is Squirrly Addressing the Core Web Vitals SEO Scoring Method? =
Squirrly is addressing them with Focus Pages.

Page experience has been one of the main reasons we’ve created Focus Pages and it goes a little beyond just pagespeed and coding propriety.

Time on page, bounce rates, number of pages visited are also very important and we’re getting clear signals that their importance is shifting.

We already address pagespeed and https and give resources to our users, so they are prepared for the update.

https://howto.squirrly.co/kb/focus-pages-page-audits/

= What is the advantage of using Squirrly’s keyword research tool instead of using an external tool for this? =
Squirrly’s built-in keyword research tool allows you to perform keyword research without leaving WordPress.

Furthermore, Squirrly also provides access to features like Briefcase, which means you can not only find keywords but also organize them into tighter groups for a better strategy. Furthermore, our keyword research data is fresh, since we don’t use caching (cached databases). 

Maximum caching time is about 48 hours, not a whole year or two years like you find in other tools.

As we use Google API for search volume, Social Media for discussions, the data should be fresh every time and this is why it is different from others – and also why the data we show is different from what you may find in other keyword research tools who use caching for their data. (caching time can be extremely high for some of those tools).

https://howto.squirrly.co/kb/keyword-research-and-seo-strategy/

= Can you guarantee SEO results? =
If you follow what we outline here, then yes. We will guarantee (please read the following resource):

https://plugin.squirrly.co/squirrly-seo-pro-results-guarantee/

= Why is Squirrly Keyword Research better than Google Keyword Planner for SEO strategies? =

Because our tool focuses on the information your need to better rank on Google not to get your Ads in front of more people. Google Keyword Planner is a great research tool if you are creating Adwords campaigns. For SEO our keyword generator tool is better.

= I can't log into the Wordpress with my user. Get the message 'An error occured.' What can I do? =
I see that your host server is not letting you access our remote API.
Please tell your webmaster to add the IPs 176.9.121.162 and 176.9.112.210 in the white-list for remote access and it should work.
